I could use some mead right now...
So far away from home...
I could use a warm fire and a belly full of mead.
Shh, did you hear that?
Stay alert!
Keep your eyes peeled.
I think I heard something.
Keep your blade sharp.
Bah, stupid land... stupid weather.
Long nights and hard days...
Raining again...
So Hungry...
I need more moondust...
Beware!
