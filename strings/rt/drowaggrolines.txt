You will DIE in DARKNESS!
Weak - just like la rest of your kind!
Surrender and perhaps I'll grant you un quick death, oui?
Skewer them! Let their screams echo throughout la caverns!
Bleed, wretch! Your agony is un symphony to mon ears!
Nothing but death awaits you down here, fool.
You are nothing but un worm beneath mon heel. Perish!
Squirm, insect!
I want to hear you BEG before l'end!
I'll take mon time breaking you, piece by piece!
Your life ends here, fool!
Mon dieu!
En garde!
